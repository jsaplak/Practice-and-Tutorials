# Practice and Tutorials

You will find many of the Projects I work on in this repo, most will be thowaway scripts and CRUD apps as well as unimportant tutorials and tests. 

They will be sorted by Language in respective folders: primarily C and Python for now. Any miscellaneous code in other langauges will be in the **misc** folder until there is enough of one language to warrant its own folder or repo.
